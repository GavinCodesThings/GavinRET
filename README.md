# GavinRET
GavnRET (Gavin Reverse Engineering Toolbox) is a suite of tools to help you reverse engineer and analyze software.

Coded in C# and C++

## What does it come with?
### Disassembler
Allows you to view a program's assembly code

Might include a decompiler and strings window in the future

### Memory Scanner
Allows you to scan a process's memory (kinda like Cheat Engine)

### Lua Deobfuscator/Constant Dumper
Allows you to deobfuscate/dump obfuscated Lua code

Currently only works on IronBrew2

### NamedPipe Viewer
Allows you to view a list of all active NamedPipes

### DLL Injector
Allows you to inject DLLs into a process

### Signature Scanner
Allows you to scan for memory addresses using sigs

## What might be added in the future?
### Decompiler
If this gets added, it will work along with the diassembler to generate C-like code from assembly code

### XREF Scanner
If added, it allows you to scan for XREFs to get memory addresses (kinda self explanatory but ok.)
